It automates the research of parenting essentials, covering newborn product recommendations, maternity necessities, parental education resources, and postpartum behavioral management strategies in a consolidated, easy-to-read format.\n\n## ❓ Problem Statement\n\nWhen couples discover they are expecting, the initial thrill is often accompanied by anxiety regarding how to raise a new life. Parents typically spend countless hours manually researching baby shopping lists, maternity needs, parenting guides, and budgeting advice. This manual process is time-consuming and often overwhelming due to information overload, leaving parents stressed rather than excited.\n\n## 🛠️ Solution Statement\n\nAgent MaBaba solves this information overload by leveraging Agentic AI to act as a personalized consultant. Instead of parents manually sifting through search results, the tool autonomously navigates the internet to curate top-rated products, verify vendors, and aggregate educational guidelines. It transforms hours of scattered browsing into instant, structured, and actionable reports.\n\n## ⚙️ Architecture\n\nThe project is built using the **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)** and powered by the **Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite** model. It utilizes a hierarchical \"Router-Solver\" architecture:\n\n  * **Root Agent (`agent_mababa`):** Acts as the central orchestrator that analyzes user intent and delegates tasks to specific sub-agents.\n  * **Specialized Sub-Agents:**\n      * `newborn_product_research_agent`: Fetches top-rated baby gear using Google Search and formats data into JSON.\n      * `newmom_product_research_agent`: Researches pre- and post-natal maternity products.\n      * `parental_education_research_agent`: Curates classes, books, and expert guidelines.\n      * `behavioral_support_consultant`: Provides strategies for common daily parenting challenges.\n      * `budgeting_agent_no_calc`: Helps in making a baby budget.\n  * **Tools:** All agents utilize the `Google Search` tool for real-time information retrieval.\n\n## 💎 Value Statement\n\nAgent MaBaba adds significant value by saving parents hours of tedious internet research. It streamlines the preparation process by delivering reliable, high-quality information and product recommendations, allowing parents to focus on the joy of their growing family rather than the stress of logistics.\n\n## 🔭 Future Scope\n\n  * **Financial Planning:** Adding capabilities for baby budgeting and financial strategies (e.g., college funds).\n  * **Educational Roadmap:** Researching local school districts and educational guidelines.\n  * **Safety & Home:** Generating guides for baby-proofing the house based on floor plans.\n  * **Dynamic Agents:** Moving from fixed agent definitions to dynamic agent spawning based on unique user queries.\n  * **Medical Research:** Expanded capabilities to research common health issues and medical guidelines.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Section 1: Imports & Setups","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import json\nfrom typing import Any, Optional\nimport datetime\nfrom google.adk.agents import Agent, SequentialAgent, ParallelAgent, LoopAgent\nfrom google.adk.models.google_llm import Gemini\nfrom google.adk.runners import InMemoryRunner, Runner\nfrom google.adk.tools import AgentTool, FunctionTool, google_search\nfrom google.genai import types\nfrom google.genai.types import Content, Part\nfrom google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService, VertexAiSessionService\nfrom google.adk.sessions import BaseSessionService\nfrom google.adk.agents.callback_context import CallbackContext\nprint(\"✅ Package inclusion complete.\")","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-27T23:08:59.134418Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-27T23:08:59.134845Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-27T23:09:52.967986Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-27T23:08:59.134814Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-27T23:09:52.966760Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nfrom kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient\n\ntry:\n    GOOGLE_API_KEY = UserSecretsClient().get_secret(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\")\n    os.environ[\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\"] = GOOGLE_API_KEY\n    print(\"✅ Gemini API key setup complete.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\n        f\"🔑 Authentication Error: Please make sure you have added 'GOOGLE_API_KEY' to your Kaggle secrets.
